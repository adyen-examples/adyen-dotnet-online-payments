# Adyen [Tokenization](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments-tokenization) Integration Demo



## Details

This repository includes a tokenization example for subscriptions. Within this demo app, you'll find a simplified version of a website that offers a music subscription service. The shopper can purchase a subscription and administrators can manage the saved (tokenized) payment methods on a separate admin panel. The panel allows admins to make payments on behalf of the shopper using this token. We refer to this token as `recurringDetailReference` in this application.



## Requirements

- .NET Core SDK 6.x.
- A set of API Keys: 
    - [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key) `ADYEN_API_KEY`
    - [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication) `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY`
    - [Merchant Account](https://docs.adyen.com/account/account-structure) `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT`
    - [HMAC Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures) `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY`
- A way to make your localhost publicly available (we have highlighted two options below).



## Run integration on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
1. Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).
 
2. Go to [Gitpod Environmental Variables](https://gitpod.io/variables) and set the following variables: `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY` and `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` with a scope of `*/*`.

3. To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, add `https://*.gitpod.io` as allowed origin by going to your MerchantAccount in the Customer Area: `Developers` → `API credentials` → Find your `ws_user` → `Client settings` → `Add Allowed origins`.

4. To receive notifications asynchronously, add a webhook: 
    - In the Customer Area go to `Developers` → `Webhooks` and add a new `Standard notification webhook`
    - Define username and password (Basic Authentication) to protect your endpoint
    - Generate the HMAC Key and set the `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY` in your [Gitpod Environment Variables](https://gitpod.io/variables)
    - We will need to update this webhook URL in step 7
    - Make sure the webhook is **Enabled** to send notifications

5. In Additional Settings, add the data you want to receive. Checkmark `Recurring Details` for subscriptions

6. Click the button below to launch the application in Gitpod.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-dotnet-online-payments/tree/main/subscription-example)

7. Update your webhook in the Customer Area with the public url that is generated by Gitpod.
 - In the Customer Area go to `Developers` → `Webhooks` → Select your `Webhook` that is created in step 4 -> `Server Configuration`
 - Update the URL of your application/endpoint (e.g. `https://8080-myorg-myrepo-y8ad7pso0w5.ws-eu75.gitpod.io/api/webhooks/notifications/`).
 - Hit `Apply` → `Save changes` and Gitpod should be able to receive notifications.



## Run integration on localhost using a proxy

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-dotnet-online-payments.git
```

2. To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, add `https://*.localhost:5001` as allowed origin by going to your MerchantAccount in the Customer Area: `Developers` → `API credentials` → Find your `ws_user` → `Client settings` → `Add Allowed origins`.

Your endpoint that will consume the incoming webhook must be publicly accessible. To expose your endpoint locally, we have highlighted two options in step 3 or 4. Choose one or consider alternative tunneling software.

3. Expose your localhost with Visual Studio using dev tunnels.
     - Add `https://*.devtunnels.ms` to your allowed origins.
     - Login to Visual Studio
     - Under `Options` → `Environment` → `Preview Features` → Check `Enable dev tunnels for Web Application`
     - Select `adyen_dotnet_subscription_example_port_tunneling` as your launchSetting profile.

If you use Visual Studio 17.4 or higher, the webhook URL will be the generated URL (i.e. `https://xd1r2txt-5001.euw.devtunnels.ms`).

4. Expose your localhost with tunneling software (i.e. ngrok).
    - Add `https://*.ngrok.io` to your allowed origins.

If you use a tunneling service like ngrok, the webhook URL will be the generated URL (i.e. `https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/notifications/`).

```bash
  $ ngrok http 8080
  
  Session Status                online                                                                                           
  Account                       ############

  Region                        United States (us)                                                                                 
  Forwarding                    http://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080                                       
  Forwarding                    https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080           
```

5. To receive notifications asynchronously, add a webhook: 
    - In the Customer Area go to `Developers` → `Webhooks` and add a new `Standard notification webhook`
    - Define username and password (Basic Authentication) to protect your endpoint
    - Generate the HMAC Key
    - See script below that allows you to easily set your environmental variables. Note that some IDEs will have to be restarted for environmental variables to be injected properly
    - We will need to update this webhook URL in step 9
    - Make sure the webhook is **Enabled** to send notifications

6. Set the following environment variables in your terminal environment: `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY`, `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` and `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY`.

```shell
export ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourAdyenHmacKey
```

On Windows CMD you can use this command instead.

```shell
set ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
set ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
set ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
set ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourAdyenHmacKey
```

7. In Additional Settings, add the data you want to receive. Checkmark `Recurring Details` for subscriptions.

8. Start the application and visit localhost.

```
dotnet run --project subscription-example 
```

9. Update your webhook in your Customer Area with the public url that is generated.
    - In the Customer Area go to `Developers` → `Webhooks` → Select your `Webhook` that is created in step 4 -> `Server Configuration`
    - Update the URL of your application/endpoint (e.g. `https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/notifications/` or `https://xd1r2txt-5001.euw.devtunnels.ms`)
    - Hit `Apply` → `Save changes` and Gitpod should be able to receive notifications

**Note:** when exiting ngrok or Visual Studio a new URL is generated, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area as described in the final step. You can find more information about webhooks in [this detailed blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/Integrating-webhooks-notifications-with-Adyen-Checkout)



## Usage

1. Visit the main page 'Shopper View' to test the application, enter one or multiple card details. Once the payment is authorized, you will receive a webhook notification with the recurringDetailReference! Enter multiple cards to receive multiple different recurringDetailReferences.

To try out subscriptions with test card numbers and payment method details, see [Test card numbers](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers). We recommend saving multiple test cards in your browser so you can test your integration faster in the future.

2. Visit 'Admin Panel' to find the saved recurringDetailReferences and choose to make a payment request or disable the recurringDetailReference.

**Note:** We currently store these values in a local memory cache, if you restart/stop the application these values are lost. However, the tokens will still persist on the Adyen Platform. You can view the stored payment details by going to a recent payment of the shopper: `Transactions` → `Payments` → `Shopper Details` → `Recurring: View stored payment details` in the ca-environment.
