## Details

This repository includes examples of PCI-compliant UI integrations for online payments with Adyen. Within this demo app, you'll find a simplified version of an e-commerce website, complete with commented code to highlight key features and concepts of Adyen's API.

## Requirements

.NET Core SDK 6.x

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-dotnet-online-payments.git
```

2. Set the below environment variables in your terminal environment ([API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key), [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication), [Merchant Account](https://docs.adyen.com/account/account-structure), [HMAC Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures) - Remember to add `https://localhost:5001` as an origin for client key, and merchant account name, all credentials are in string format)

```shell
export ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourAdyenHmacKey
```

On Windows CMD you can use below commands instead

```shell
set ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
set ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
set ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
set ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourAdyenHmacKey
```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

```
dotnet run
```

2. Visit [https://localhost:5001/](https://localhost:5001/) to select an integration type.

To try out integrations with test card numbers and payment method details, see [Test card numbers](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/test-cards/test-card-numbers).


## Testing webhooks

This demo provides simple webhook integration at `/api/webhooks/notifications`. For it to work, you need to:

* Provide a way for Adyen's servers to reach your running application
* Add a standard webhook in your customer area

### Making your server reachable

One possibility is to use a service like [ngrok](ngrok) (which can be used for free).

```bash
$ ngrok http https://localhost:5001 -host-header="localhost:5001"
```

Once you have  set up ngrok, make sure to add the provided ngrok URL to the list of Allowed Origins in the â€œAPI Credentials" part of your Customer Area.

### Setting up a webhook

* In the developers -> webhooks part of the customer area, create a new 'standard notifications' webhook.
* Make sure to check 'Accept self-signed', 'Accept non-trusted root certificates' (test only) and Active.
* In additional settings, add the data you want to receive. A good example is 'Payment Account Reference'.

That's it! Every time you test a new payment method, your server will receive a notification from Adyen's server.

You can find more information about webhooks in [this detailed blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/Integrating-webhooks-notifications-with-Adyen-Checkout).
