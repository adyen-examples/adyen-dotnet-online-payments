          Adyen In-person Payments — Loyalty Demo
        </h1>
        <p>
          This self-checout demo shows how developers can perform <b>synchronous</b> card acquisition requests using Adyen's Terminal Api to enroll shoppers into a loyalty program. We'll cover <b>two</b> main flows: <br/> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <b class="highlight">1.</b> If you recognize a shopper based on the payment data, you can offer benefits like discounts, or make product recommendations based on their purchase history. 
          In this demo, you can click the <i>apply discount</i>-button when performing the self-checkout, the pizzas will be discounted when you've made over 2 purchases in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b class="highlight">2.</b> If a shopper only wants to enroll into the loyalty program, you can do so without a payment by enrolling them on the spot using the payment terminal.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          You can find your enrolled shoppers in the <b>Admin Panel</b>-tab, it includes a simple transaction history.
