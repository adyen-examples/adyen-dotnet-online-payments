      Adyen In-person Payments — Loyalty Demo
    </h1>
    <p>
      This demo shows how developers can perform <b>synchronous</b> card acquisition requests to enroll shoppers into a loyalty program. <br/> 
      <b>Note:</b> The asynchronous flow is similar and can be found <a href="https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/loyalty/#asynchronous-flow">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you recognize a shopper based on the payment data, you can offer benefits like discounts, or make product recommendations based on their purchase history. 
      If you don't recognize a shopper, you can enroll them on the spot using the payment terminal.
