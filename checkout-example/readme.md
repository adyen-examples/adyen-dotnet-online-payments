- A way to make your endpoints publicly available (we have highlighted two options below).


## Supported Integrations

**ASP.NET** demos of the following client-side integrations are currently available in this repository:

- [Drop-in](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/drop-in-web)
- [Component](https://docs.adyen.com/checkout/components-web)
  - ACH
  - Card (3DS2)

This demo leverages Adyen's API Library for .NET ([GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-dotnet-api-library) | [Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries#csharp)).
Before testing, please make sure to [add the payment methods to your Adyen Account](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods#add-payment-methods-to-your-account).

## Run integration on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
1. Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).

2. Go to [Gitpod Environmental Variables](https://gitpod.io/variables) and set the following variables: `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY` and `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` with a scope of `*/*`.

3. To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, add `https://*.gitpod.io` as allowed origin by going to your MerchantAccount in the Customer Area: `Developers` → `API credentials` → Find your `ws_user` → `Client settings` → `Add Allowed origins`.
> **Warning** You should only allow wild card (*) domains in the **test** environment. In a **live** environment, you should specify the exact URL of the application.

This demo provides a simple webhook integration at `/api/webhooks/notifications`. For it to work, you need to provide a way for Adyen's servers to reach your running application and add a standard webhook in the Customer Area.
To expose this endpoint locally, we have highlighted two options in step 4 or 5. Choose one or consider alternative tunneling software.

4. To receive notifications asynchronously, add a webhook:
  - In the Customer Area go to `Developers` → `Webhooks` and add a new `Standard notification webhook`
- Define username and password (Basic Authentication) to [protect your endpoint](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/best-practices#security)
  - Generate the HMAC Key and set the `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY` in your [Gitpod Environment Variables](https://gitpod.io/variables)
  - For the URL, enter `https://gitpod.io` for now - We will need to update this webhook URL in step 7
  - Make sure the webhook is **Enabled** to send notifications

5. In the Customer Area, go to `Developers` → `Additional Settings` → Under `Acquirer` enable `Payment Account Reference` to receive the Payment Account Reference.

6. Click the button below to launch the application in Gitpod.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-dotnet-online-payments/tree/main/checkout-example)

7. Update your webhook in the Customer Area with the public url that is generated by Gitpod.
- In the Customer Area, go to `Developers` → `Webhooks` → Select your `Webhook` that is created in step 4 → `Server Configuration`
- Update the URL of your application/endpoint (e.g. `https://8080-myorg-myrepo-y8ad7pso0w5.ws-eu75.gitpod.io/api/webhooks/notifications/`).
- Hit `Apply` → `Save changes` and Gitpod should be able to receive notifications.

> **Note:** when exiting Gitpod a new URL is generated, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area as described in the final step. 
> You can find more information about webhooks in [this detailed blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/Integrating-webhooks-notifications-with-Adyen-Checkout)


## Run integration on localhost using a proxy

1. Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-dotnet-online-payments.git
```

2. Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).

3. To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, add `https://localhost:5001` as allowed origin by going to your MerchantAccount in the Customer Area: `Developers` → `API credentials` → Find your `ws_user` → `Client settings` → `Add Allowed origins`.
> **Warning:** You should only allow wild card (*) domains in the **test** environment. In a **live** environment, you should specify the exact URL of the application.

This demo provides a simple webhook integration at `/api/webhooks/notifications`. For it to work, you need to provide a way for Adyen's servers to reach your running application and add a standard webhook in the Customer Area.
To expose this endpoint locally, we have highlighted two options in step 4 or 5. Choose one or consider alternative tunneling software.

4. Expose your localhost with Visual Studio using dev tunnels.
  - Add `https://*.devtunnels.ms` to your allowed origins.
  - Login to Visual Studio
  - Under `Options` → `Environment` → `Preview Features` → Check `Enable dev tunnels for Web Application`
  - Select `adyen_dotnet_checkout_example_port_tunneling` as your launchSetting profile.

If you use Visual Studio 17.4 or higher, the webhook URL will be the generated URL (i.e. `https://xd1r2txt-5001.euw.devtunnels.ms`).

5. Expose your localhost with tunneling software (i.e. ngrok).
  - Add `https://*.ngrok.io` to your allowed origins.

If you use a tunneling service like ngrok, the webhook URL will be the generated URL (i.e. `https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/notifications/`).

```bash
  $ ngrok http 8080
  
  Session Status                online                                                                                           
  Account                       ############

  Region                        United States (us)                                                                                 
  Forwarding                    http://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080                                       
  Forwarding                    https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080           
```

6. To receive notifications asynchronously, add a webhook:
  - In the Customer Area go to `Developers` → `Webhooks` and add a new `Standard notification webhook`
  - Define username and password (Basic Authentication) to [protect your endpoint](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/best-practices#security)
  - Generate the HMAC Key
  - See script below that allows you to easily set your environmental variables. Note that some IDEs will have to be restarted for environmental variables to be injected properly
  - For the URL, enter `https://ngrok.io` for now - We will need to update this webhook URL in step 10
  - Make sure the webhook is **Enabled** to send notifications

7. Set the following environment variables in your terminal environment: `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY`, `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT` and `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY`.

```shell
export ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourAdyenHmacKey
```

On Windows CMD you can use this command instead.

```shell
set ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
set ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
set ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
set ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourAdyenHmacKey
```

8. In the Customer Area, go to `Developers` → `Additional Settings` → Under `Acquirer` enable `Payment Account Reference` to receive the Payment Account Reference.

9. Start the application and visit localhost.

```shell
dotnet run --project checkout-example 
```

10. Update your webhook in your Customer Area with the public url that is generated.
  - In the Customer Area go to `Developers` → `Webhooks` → Select your `Webhook` that is created in step 6 → `Server Configuration`
  - Update the URL of your application/endpoint (e.g. `https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/notifications/` or `https://xd1r2txt-5001.euw.devtunnels.ms`)
  - Hit `Apply` → `Save changes` and Gitpod should be able to receive notifications

> **Note:** when exiting ngrok or Visual Studio a new URL is generated, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area as described in the final step.
